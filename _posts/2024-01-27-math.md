The integral of mass was a quite challenging concept in Physics class, for me and some of my friends, considering the fact that we havn't learned the Integral itself yet. Therefore it becomes a kind of meme between us, when we want to mention something confusing!
$$
x_{cm} = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n m_i x}{M} = \frac{\int x\, dm}{\int dm}
$$
