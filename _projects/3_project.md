This project was done in August 2021, step-by-step.
Initially, it was just a server and only one client that connected to the server and recived a bunch of messages (like radio but only for one person), then they were more clients and handeling them with threads (like a public radio), then it was send and recive between server and clients.
After a quite process clients were able to send message to another client (more like an email).

Then after a revolutionary adjustment and restablishing the base, it turned to a big public chat room for everyone, after the ability to create your own chat-room and setting password on it to make it private, I added credit to each user and so many features left on the todo list of that project such as groups, labels, friends, public announcements, etc.

I executed the whole project on a cloud server which I rented especially for this project. It is import to mention that the main motive to make a social chat-room system like this was not itself, but my interest in security matters and issues.

So I turn off the protection and firewall of that server manually and started attacking my own server, (!) DOS and some Trojan attacks. After successfully taking down the server and stealing some data (that I already had it on my laptop as well!), I was trying to counter-back that and create a protection for my system against DOS attacks and adding better encryption algorithms to the messages and the stored data and some other works, I was successfull in preventing myself to destroy my own system, except for the DDOS attacks that I requested from a freind of mine!

After reaching a good situation in the process, me and my friends tested the server via several devices and it was really cool to have your own (almost) secure chat app with your friends in terminal!
