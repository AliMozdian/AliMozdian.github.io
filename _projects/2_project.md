This was ment to be a class project (+25 people) but it ends up to me designing and coding the whole game, and 2 of my friends helped me a little bit in the process, and the only graphist of the team gave me some of the pixel-art images and I found the rest on FlatIcon by myself.
So it was more than a personal weekly project than a team project, I had the whole project uploaded to a server but at the moment the service that I used is turn out to be not safe, so I don't attach the link to the project untill I upload that on my GitHub.
