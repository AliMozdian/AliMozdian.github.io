My name is Ali Mozdianfard, and I'm currently a student of Computer Engineering at IUST.
I have been programming since I was 12 years old, which has given me an advantage over those who started later.
Programming has always been a hobby for me, and I find it enjoyable and rewarding.

I started coding with Python and later learned C++ and QBasic in parallel with Python.
I used C++ for solving Codeforces problems and QBasic to develop a simple mobile app for our school's annual seminar.
Unfortunately, the seminar was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

During the quarantine era of 2020-2021, I started learning C# for developing an FPS game via Unity in a team of six.
Currently, I am learning and using C in the university.
Initially, I was uninterested in the family of C languages because of my preference for Python. However, after understanding the power of freely doing anything with C in lower levels of programming (closer to machine language), I regretted my avoidance and developed an eagerness for C.
